      The satellite orbits Earth at an altitude of approximately 525 km, storing the names in its memory. Ground stations communicate with the satellite during its passes, transmitting the names that people have submitted through the website.

    <p class="artwork-text artwork-text--section-end">
      When you submit a name, it joins a queue and will be transmitted to the satellite during the next available pass. You'll receive an email confirmation when your name has been successfully uploaded to the Orbital Temple.
