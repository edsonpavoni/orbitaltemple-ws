      Brief History of Art in Space

      Ever since the first successful launch of an artificial satellite in <strong>1957</strong>, over ten thousand satellites have come to orbit around Earth. In this new era, artists have found a way to expand their practice and outer space has become a new kind of canvas. With that, fundamental questions about the politics of space exploration have arised - though a lot more ground has yet to be covered.

      Earlier artistic achievements in space include the drawing of a sunrise over Earth, made by Russian astronaut <strong>Alexei Leonov</strong> whilst on board of the Voskhod 2 in <strong>1965</strong>. Three years later, <strong>Moon Museum</strong>, a miniscule ceramic plate supposedly landed on the Moon with inscriptions by six of the most prominent artists in the US at the time: <strong>Robert Rauschenberg</strong>, <strong>David Novros</strong>, <strong>John Chamberlain</strong>, <strong>Claes Oldenburg</strong>, <strong>Forrest Myers</strong> and <strong>Andy Warhol</strong>.

    In <strong>1971</strong>, a small scale humanoid aluminum sculpture called <strong>Fallen Astronaut</strong> was placed on the Moon by Apollo 15 astronaut <strong>David Scott</strong>. Belgian artist <strong>Paul Van Hoeydonck</strong> intended, with this piece, to commemorate the astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the advancement of space exploration.

    <p class="artwork-text">
      In the <strong>1970's</strong>, both the <strong>Pioneer Plaques</strong> and the <strong>Voyager Probes</strong> set new horizons for art in space. Carrying gold-anodized aluminum plaques with visual messages from Earth to any other spacefarers that might find it in the distant future, they depicted human life in its most fundamental elements.

    <p class="artwork-text">
      It was not until <strong>2014</strong> that the first purely artistic satellite was launched. The University of Tokyo's <strong>ARTSAT-1 Invader</strong> project sent spatial data to Earth that was used in art installations and music creation. Another artistic satellite was the <strong>Ulises I</strong> mission, developed by the Coletivo Espacial Mexicano with support from the Arizona State University, and launched by a balloon in <strong>2016</strong>.

    <p class="artwork-text">
      In <strong>2018</strong>, a passive CubeSat built as an art project was launched into orbit. Developed by bahamian conceptual artist <strong>Tavares Strachan</strong>, <strong>Enoch</strong> contains a 24-karat-gold canopic jar with a bust of the first African-American astronaut, <strong>Robert Henry Lawrence Jr</strong>. In that same year, <strong>Trevor Paglen's</strong> <strong>Orbital Reflector</strong> was also launched as a sculpture housed in a nonfunctional CubeSat.

      According to his website, the work is perceived as his artistic gesture that could help change the way we see our place in the world. It was not deployed correctly, never opening up as it should have; it is, as of <strong>2019</strong>, officially lost in space and cannot presently be tracked.

    <p class="artwork-text artwork-text--section-end">
      In <strong>2025</strong>, after 4 years of reseach and development, Brazilian artist <strong>Edson Pavoni</strong> and a multidisciplinary group of collaborators will launch the first purely artistic orbital satellite from the Global South into space.
