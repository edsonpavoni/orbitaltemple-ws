      No artist can be truly secular.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Let me tell you how I discovered this.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      I was born in the outskirts of São Paulo, in a neighborhood that taught me early what danger means. Many of my school friends are in jail now. My step-father is in jail. Violence wasn't something I read about; and I knew I needed to scape.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Technology became that world. Learned to program, learned electronics as a teenager were tools for survival. Code was a language that could take me somewhere else. Work with technology was my way out of poverty.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      But I was also searching for belonging, for love, for something to believe in. I found Christianity, or it found me. I was accepted. I was loved. I had a community. I learned to forgive, to believe, to move together for a greater purpose. The price, though, was high. I also learned many things that I am successfully unlearning. So I escaped from that too.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      What followed were years of searching for something I couldn't name. God died during those years. The god I'd been taught about, anyway, the one with rules and judgment and doors that only opened for some people. I started making art to explore questions: about intimacy and technology, about memory and death, about who deserves heaven. I became obsessed with building machines that propose positive imaginaries for our relationship with technology—machines that need your participation, your presence, your name, to transform from metal and code into something alive.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Then the pandemic hit Brazil.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      When my government was delaying COVID vaccines, they were negotiating kickbacks of 1 dollar per dose. They were indicating medicine that was understood to not be effective, laughing while people lost their air. At that time, we woke up every day to a different number. How many people died in the last 24 hours? Was it more, or less than expected? Was the curve being flattened?
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Half of the world was scared, and another half was in denial. We were at war, with the virus and with each other.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Most Brazilian artists, in lockdown, decided to do something. Online music and shows, performances, theater. We were protesting, caring, organizing and fighting. I wanted to contribute as an artist to that time, so I created something in the territory of peace. And together with hundreds of people I created the Memorial Inumeráveis.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      An artwork in the intersection of art and journalism. We interviewed families that had lost someone. We then wrote the life story of the person we lost. We transformed numbers into histories. Poems, songs, symphonies were made with those histories. Newspapers created covers using the names and histories. All the Brazilian stars—Selton Melo, Seu Jorge, so many others—read those stories on national television. The project reached 32 million people, one in four Brazilian adults. It became a network of healing, a collective monument to memory.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      The media used those histories every week, and I was on TV almost every week for a year. All because no one wants to be a number. Everyone deserves to exist in prose.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      After so many years of writing these stories, more than ten thousand conversations with grief, a pattern started to emerge. When we talk about someone who has died, we don't just say good things; we select fragments of their story as if we're writing a letter of recommendation. A recommendation to the gatekeeper of paradise. We do our best to send them to heaven.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      That's when something shifted. As I listened to thousands of stories, as I started writing a book about this work, something I thought was dead came back to life. Not the god from my evangelical past, not the god with walls and rules. Something else. And I understood: No artist can be truly secular.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      We artists are forever tied to our common ancestor, the shaman. In the beginning, there was a cave. Humans painted animals on walls not to decorate, but to invoke. They danced, and the cave became a temple. That impulse never left us. As the shaman wields the spirit of ritual, the artist wields the aura of art. By this common root, we are forever connected. Every artist who has ever lived carries it. We paint, we sculpt, we code, we design our desired future not to decorate, but to invoke. All art is spiritual, even when it claims not to be.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      But here's what I learned from those thousands of conversations with grieving families: We've been wounded by the very temples we built. Our beliefs about who deserves heaven directly shape who we exclude on Earth. The Portuguese colonizers in Brazil believed Black people had no souls; that belief justified slavery. If you were indigenous, LGBTQIAP+, if you were born in the wrong place or loved the wrong person, you were told heaven's doors were closed to you.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Latin America has suffered violently from these imaginaries about life after death. And the most consequential part of any temple has always been its door. The doors of temples hold power to cut, to draw a wound between who can enter and who cannot. That's how a temple becomes a sword.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      No temple on Earth can be radically inclusive. There is no place on this planet that can hold the universal sacred without walls, without separation, without someone standing at the door deciding who belongs. Yet all peoples who ever lived built temples, proof that something sacred unites us. Something that sees no borders. Something that deserves a place of its own.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Where could we build such a temple?<br>
      Where no walls can reach.<br>
      Where no nation can claim.<br>
      Where no religion can rule.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Space.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Orbital Temple is a continuation of my artistic practice. It's a development of my previous works and of my journey investigating the fundamentals of human connection and technology—and I hope you'll embark on this journey with us.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      A participatory art satellite from the Global South. A temple in orbit that invites everyone to send their names to space, regardless of who they are, where they were born, who they love, what they believe. The first place where radical inclusion is possible—in orbit, beyond borders.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      It's also a statement about who gets to access space, who gets to dream beyond Earth's atmosphere. This mission is open source; every technical document, every line of code will be freely available so other artists, other communities, other nations can build their own satellites. So the Global South doesn't just participate in space exploration, but leads it.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      A peaceful artwork? In this world?<br>
      It's not outrageous, it's not polemic, so in the world of polarities, it's not sexy.<br>
      I'm Brazilian, believe me, I know.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Yes. It is not outrageous, polemic. It will not drive the rage of the algorithms of our era.<br>
      Good. It's time to remember that only peace is truly revolutionary.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Accepting you and your adversary<br>
      Is not sexy nowadays<br>
      This artwork is not outrageous<br>
      Yes<br>
      In our times peace is still revolutionary
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      This is the synthesis of my journey. A kid from the dangerous outskirts of São Paulo, who learned code to escape, who searched for god in churches and then in searching, who lost faith and found it again in the voices of thousands telling stories of their dead, building a temple where everyone belongs.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      We are still in a cave, you and I. The vast darkness of space surrounds us, and Earth is the torch, the only place we know consciousness exists for sure. We're still painting our desired future on walls, still dancing to invoke what wants to be born. My machines need people to be art. They need your name, your participation, your presence.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      No artist can be truly secular. Because art is the work of giving body to what we believe must exist, what we hope can protect us, what we trust will heal us. That's what the shaman did. That's what I'm doing. That's what we're doing together.
