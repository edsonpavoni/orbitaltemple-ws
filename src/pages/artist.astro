      No artist can be truly secular.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Let me tell you how I discovered this.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      I was born in the outskirts of São Paulo, in a neighborhood that taught me early what danger means. Many of my school friends are in jail now. My step-father is in jail. Violence wasn't something I read about – it was the air I breathed. And I understood, maybe earlier than I should have, that I needed to create a new world if I wanted to escape.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Technology became that world. Learning to program, learning electronics as a teenager – these weren't hobbies. They were tools for survival. Code was a language that could take me somewhere else. Technology was my way out of poverty.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      But I was also searching for belonging, for love, for something to believe in. I found Christianity, or it found me. A kind of cult, actually, but at the time it felt like salvation. I was accepted. I was loved. I had a community. The price, though, was high: a prison of the mind, sexual shame, the suffocation of who I really was. So I escaped from that too.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      What followed were ten years of chaos. Sex, drugs, searching for something I couldn't name. God died during those years. The god I'd been taught about, anyway – the one with rules and judgment and doors that only opened for some people. I started making art, at first, to expose what I saw as the fallacy of heaven, the lie of paradise used to control us.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      But something was happening in that chaos. Technology wasn't just my escape anymore – it was becoming a bridge. I started building machines, installations, sculptures. Not machines that work on their own, but machines that need people to become art. I became obsessed with a question: Will the development of technology drive us further apart, or bring us closer together?
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      That question became the core of my practice. I build machines that propose positive imaginaries for our relationship with technology. Machines that amplify human connection instead of replacing it. Machines that need your participation, your presence, your name, to transform from metal and code into something sacred.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Then the pandemic came to Brazil.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Five hundred thousand people died. There's so much power in a name – David, Abdias, Carolina – but in the news, we rarely saw names. Only numbers. Covid-19 victims became statistics, hollow and cold. No one wants to be reduced to a number. People deserve to exist in prose.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      So I founded the Inumeráveis Memorial in 2020, together with hundreds of volunteers who interviewed thousands of family members, friends, loved ones. We wrote life stories. Fourteen thousand of them. We listened. The project reached 32 million people – one in four Brazilian adults. It became a network of healing, a collective monument to memory.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      After more than two years of writing these stories, more than ten thousand conversations with grief, a pattern started to emerge. When we talk about someone who has died, we don't just say good things – we select fragments of their story as if we're writing a letter of recommendation. A recommendation to the gatekeeper of paradise. We do our best to send them to heaven.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      That's when something shifted. As I listened to thousands of stories, as I started writing a book about this work, something I thought was dead came back to life. Not the god from my evangelical past, not the god with walls and rules. Something else. And I understood: No artist can be truly secular.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      We artists are forever tied to our common ancestor – the shaman. In the beginning, there was a cave. Humans painted animals on walls not to decorate, but to invoke. They danced, and the cave became a temple. That impulse never left us. Every artist who has ever lived carries it. We paint, we sculpt, we code, we design our desired future not to decorate, but to invoke. All art is spiritual, even when it claims not to be.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      But here's what I learned from those thousands of conversations with grieving families: We've been wounded by the very temples we built. The Portuguese colonizers in Brazil believed Black people had no souls – that belief justified slavery. If you were indigenous, LGBTQIAP+, if you were born in the wrong place or loved the wrong person, you were told heaven's doors were closed to you.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Latin America has suffered violently from these imaginaries about life after death. And the most consequential part of any temple has always been its door. The doors of temples hold power to cut, to draw a wound between who can enter and who cannot. That's how a temple becomes a sword.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      No temple on Earth can be radically inclusive. There is no place on this planet that can hold the universal sacred without walls, without separation, without someone standing at the door deciding who belongs. Yet all peoples who ever lived built temples, proof that something sacred unites us. Something that sees no borders. Something that deserves a place of its own.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Where could we build such a temple?<br>
      Where no walls can reach.<br>
      Where no nation can claim.<br>
      Where no religion can rule.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Space.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Orbital Temple is the first artistic satellite from the Global South. It's not the first art in space – that lineage goes back to Alexei Leonov drawing while floating outside his spacecraft in 1965. But it is the first participatory temple in orbit, the first one that invites everyone to send their names to space, regardless of who they are, where they were born, who they love, what they believe.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      It's also a statement about who gets to access space, who gets to dream beyond Earth's atmosphere. For too long, space has been the domain of wealthy nations while developing countries face the devastating consequences of climate change driven by inequality. This mission is open source – every technical document, every line of code will be freely available so other artists, other communities, other nations can build their own satellites. So the Global South doesn't just participate in space exploration, but leads it.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      This is the synthesis of my journey. A kid from the dangerous outskirts of São Paulo, who learned code to escape, who searched for god in churches and then in chaos, who lost faith and found it again in the voices of thousands telling stories of their dead, building a temple where everyone belongs.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      We are still in a cave, you and I. The vast darkness of space surrounds us, and Earth is the torch, the only place we know consciousness exists for sure. We're still painting our desired future on walls, still dancing to invoke what wants to be born. My machines need people to be art. They need your name, your participation, your presence.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      No artist can be truly secular. Because art is the work of giving body to what we believe must exist, what we hope can protect us, what we trust will heal us. That's what the shaman did. That's what I'm doing. That's what we're doing together.
