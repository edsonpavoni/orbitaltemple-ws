    <p class="artwork-text">
      I was born in a dangerous place. I escaped. Christianity welcomed me in — not the peaceful kind, but the kind that asks for obedience. For a while, I found what I needed: love, care, belonging.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      The price was a prison. A prison of mind, of body, of desire. Shame became daily bread.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      When I finally broke free, I ran in the opposite direction — ten years of chaos, of sex, of drugs, of noise. And God died.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      I began this work wanting to expose the fallacy of heaven. But while I was writing The Immoral Artist — a book that builds on Benjamin and Flusser to imagine how artists create new imaginaries for the future — something unexpected happened. God returned. Not as a figure, but as a pulse.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      As I wrote about the origins of art — about the cave, the ritual, the act of evoking — I felt a strange movement in my body, an intuition that I could not unsee: no artist can be truly secular.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Art is always a spiritual act, even when it claims not to be. We artists are descendants of the first shamans — those who gave shape to the invisible, who built bridges between the living and what lies beyond. The shaman wields ritual. The artist wields aura. They are branches of the same tree.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Salvador Dalí once said all art is religious. I used to hate that. Anyone who has suffered under religion flinches at the word. But its root — religare, to reconnect — is precisely what we all seek.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      Every human is born in separation. We spend the rest of life trying to return — through love, through creation, through each other.
    </p>

    <p class="artwork-text">
      To deny that root is to deny one's own family. You can reason your way around it with the tools of the Greeks, but the mystery remains. It breathes inside every act of creation.
