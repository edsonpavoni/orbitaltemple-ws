      The Artwork
    </h1>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p class="body-text">
      Orbital Temple is a satellite with an artistic mission: a memorial in outer space open to every sentient being who live or (has) lived on Earth.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text body-text--section-end">
      Through technological means, anyone can send the name of someone close to the Temple, either someone who passed away, a person very much alive, or any being that deserves a memory, on an orbital prayer to space.
    </p>

      The Sculpture
    </h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      The artwork has three co-dependent elements: a satellite especially designed to store letters of names; a public sculpture exchanging information with the satellite; and a website through which participants send the names, from now until they are passed away, to heaven.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text body-text--section-end">
      As a multidisciplinary endeavor, Orbital Temple can be considered a site-specific sculpture, inhabiting space. It is also also an Art/Sci project.
    </p>

      The Antenna As A Public Sculpture
    </h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      An antenna connecting us with outer space.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      An antenna that will be in direct communication with the orbital satellite is being designed.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      With a golden reflective surface, mirroring the sky above it, it is a starting point for mass stimulation (or our relationship to what's 'up there').
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      While the sculptures are not installed in most parts of the world, our Frames from Earth, which are currently controlling the satellite, is sending the names at each passthrough.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text body-text--section-end">
      Be a sponsor of this project and help create antennas in your city that can open discussions about space exploration, art and beyond that is.
