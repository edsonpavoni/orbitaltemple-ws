    <p class="artwork-text">
      The satellite was built to endure extreme vibration, temperature shifts, and cosmic radiation. But the saying is true: space is hard. Many things can go wrong. The rocket could fail to deploy the satellite. The antenna might not unfold. The signal could never be acquired. A solar flare could disrupt communication. A single miscalculated spin could end its orbit early.

      If the first launch fails, we will take it as a sign. A sign to try again until the temple finds its place in the sky.
