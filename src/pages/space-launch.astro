      Risks
    </h2>

    <p class="body-text">
      The satellite was built to endure extreme vibration, temperature shifts, and cosmic radiation. But the saying is true: space is hard. Many things can go wrong. The rocket could fail to deploy the satellite. The antenna might not unfold. The signal could never be acquired. A solar flare could disrupt communication. A single miscalculated spin could end its orbit early.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
      Additionally, the satellite may stay in orbit for less than 10 years, or suffer malfunctions from causes we did not anticipate. Space is unpredictable, and even with rigorous testing and preparation, the unknown remains part of every space mission.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text body-text--section-end">
      If the first launch fails, or if we are unable to accomplish this mission as planned, we will learn from our mistakes and launch a better version of the satellite. We will do that until we accomplish the mission of creating a temple in space. Failure is not the end. It is part of the journey.
