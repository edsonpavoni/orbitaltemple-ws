      As a part of its educational mission, it has a multi language course for Global South teens on how to build and launch a satellite. It will be a hands-on opportunity to learn about satellite technology and put it into practice. Anyone above the age of 16 will be able to build their own satellite, learning about the history of art in space, fundamental concepts of electronics, mechanics and space science, including how to finance the projects and how to build an antenna to communicate with the satellite in orbit.
