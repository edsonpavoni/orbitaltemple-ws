Space Launch

The Orbital Temple is scheduled to be launched in November 28th from the ISRO Space Center in Sriharikota island, India.

The Orbital Temple launch is a partnership between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), OHM and All to Space.

Risks

The satellite was built to endure extreme vibration, temperature shifts, and cosmic radiation. But the saying is true: space is  hard.
Many things can go wrong. The rocket could fail to deploy the satellite. The antenna might not unfold. The signal could never be acquired. A solar flare could disrupt communication. A single miscalculated spin could end its orbit early.
If the first launch fails, we will take it as a sign. A sign to try again until the temple finds its place in the sky.
