    "heading": "The Sculpture",
    "paragraph1": "The artwork has three co-dependent elements: a satellite especially designed to store billions of names; a public sculpture exchanging information with the satellite; and a website through which participants send the names, from now until they are passed away, to heaven.",
    "paragraph2": "As a multidisciplinary endeavor, Orbital Temple can be considered a site-specific sculpture, inhabiting space. It is also an Artsat project."
