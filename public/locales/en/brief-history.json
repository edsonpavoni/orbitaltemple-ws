  "intro": "Ever since the first successful launch of an artificial satellite in <strong>1957</strong>, over ten thousand satellites have come to orbit around Earth. In this new era, artists have found a way to expand their practice and outer space has become a new kind of canvas. With that, fundamental questions about the politics of space exploration have arised - though a lot more ground has yet to be covered.",
