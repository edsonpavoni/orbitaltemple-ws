    "heading": "About the Project",
    "paragraph1": "Orbital Temple is an artwork and a satellite that aims to be a radically inclusive temple, built where no walls can reach. Created by Brazilian artist Edson Pavoni, the artist behind the Inumeráveis Memorial that reached 1 in each 6 Brazilians during the COVID pandemic, the project invites people from around the world to send the name of someone they wish to remember. These names are transmitted to a satellite in orbit, creating a collective memorial.",
    "paragraph2": "Through a website available in 136 languages, participants engage in a new kind of ritual. The Orbital Temple explores themes of inclusion, memory, and our shared humanity, questioning why no physical temple on Earth can truly welcome everyone, and proposing space as the only place where radical inclusivity might exist."

  "aboutArtist": {
    "heading": "About the Artist",
    "paragraph1": "<strong>Edson Pavoni</strong> is a Brazilian artist whose journey began in the streets of São Paulo, where a context of poverty and violence shaped his early years. In a country where Christianity offered a path away from the streets, drugs, and violence, Pavoni found refuge in faith, a theme that would later, when he became a critic of religious abuse, inform his artistic practice.",
    "paragraph2": "In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Pavoni created <strong><a href=\"https://inumeraveis.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" style=\"color: inherit; text-decoration: none; transition: text-decoration 0.2s;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.textDecoration='underline'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.textDecoration='none'\">Inumeráveis (innumerable)</a></strong>, an artwork at the intersection of art and journalism. The project interviewed thousands of families and wrote stories of those lost to the pandemic, creating a space where memory transcended numbers and statistics. Poems, songs, and symphonies were made with those stories. Newspapers created covers using the names and histories. All the Brazilian stars like Oscar winning Fernanda Torres, and stars like Selton Melo, Eva Wilma, Camila Pitanga, Debora Secco, Tais Araujo and Lazaro Ramos, and so many other read those stories on national television. The project reached 32 million people, one in four Brazilian adults. It became a network of healing, a collective monument to memory.",
    "paragraph3": "After more than ten thousand conversations with grief, a pattern emerged: when we talk about someone who has died, we select fragments of their story as if writing a letter of recommendation to the gatekeeper of paradise. We do our best to send them to what we believe is heaven. This work sparked a new understanding: Our beliefs about who deserves heaven directly shape who we accept or exclude on Earth. The Portuguese colonizers in Brazil believed Black people had no souls; that belief justified slavery. If you were indigenous, if you were born in the wrong place or loved the wrong person, you still, to this day, are told heaven's doors were closed to you. Is there a vision of the future that is not fulled by rejection?",
    "paragraph4": "That is how Orbital Temple was born."
