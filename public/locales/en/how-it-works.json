  "intro": "The Orbital Temple project consists of three interconnected elements that work together to send names to the temple in space.",
  "paragraph1": "The satellite orbits Earth at an altitude of approximately 525 km, storing the names in its memory. Ground stations communicate with the satellite during its passes, transmitting the names that people have submitted through the website.",
  "paragraph2": "When you submit a name, it joins a queue and will be transmitted to the satellite during the next available pass. You'll receive an email confirmation when your name has been successfully uploaded to the Orbital Temple.",
