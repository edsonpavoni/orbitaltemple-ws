## Artist Statement

Edson Pavoni grew up in the dangerous outskirts of São Paulo, Brazil. He learned to code as a way to escape, and discovered through art a way to explore questions about memory, inclusion, and the sacred.

"No temple on Earth can be radically inclusive. There is no place on this planet that can hold the universal sacred without walls, without separation, without someone standing at the door deciding who belongs. Yet all peoples who ever lived built temples, proof that something sacred unites us. Something that sees no borders. Something that deserves a place of its own. Where could we build such a temple? Space."

## Themes & Philosophy

**Radical Inclusion:**
Questioning why no physical temple on Earth can truly welcome everyone, and proposing space as the only place where universal accessibility might exist.

**Memory & Mortality:**
Honoring departed loved ones by sending their names beyond Earth's borders, creating a permanent memorial that transcends national, religious, and cultural boundaries.

**Space Democratization:**
Challenging the historical narrative that space belongs only to wealthy nations, and demonstrating that artists and developing regions can lead space exploration.

**Open Knowledge:**
Rejecting proprietary approaches by making all technical documentation freely available, enabling communities worldwide to build their own satellites.

**The Sacred in Space:**
Exploring what "temple" means in the 21st century, and whether technology and art can create new forms of collective ritual and meaning-making.

## Quotes for Press Use

**On Radical Inclusion:**
"No temple can be radically inclusive. There is no place on Earth that can hold the universal sacred. Yet all peoples who ever lived built temples, proof that something sacred unites us. Something that sees no borders. Something that deserves a place of its own. Where could we build such a temple? Space."

**On Participation:**
"This is different: a temple in orbit that invites everyone to send their names to space, regardless of who they are, where they were born, who they love, what they believe."

**On Global South Leadership:**
"For too long, space has been the domain of wealthy nations while developing countries face the devastating consequences of climate change driven by inequality. This mission is open source; every technical document, every line of code will be freely available so other artists, other communities, other nations can build their own satellites. So the Global South doesn't just participate in space exploration, but leads it."

**On Memory:**
"People deserve to exist in prose, not as statistics. The Orbital Temple creates a space where names can be remembered beyond borders, beyond nations, beyond the limitations of Earth."
