## Support

The last couple of years have been incredible for the **Orbital Temple Mission** ‚Äî after winning in the ArtSat category of the **CubeDesign Prize (2021)** and being one of the ten finalists of the **NTU Global Digital Art Prize**, our satellite is fully operational and launch is scheduled for 2023. **SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9** rocket is set to take the first orbital artistic satellite from the Global South into outer space.  

But we need your help to make that happen.  

Brazilian artist **Edson Pavoni** is using satellite technology as a medium to engage people in meaningful debates about life and life after death. The artwork is a **temple in outer space** ‚Äî anyone can send the name of someone who has passed away.  

We invite you to join our technologists, designers, and aerospace engineers on this mission through a **tax-deductible donation**.

### Your donation will support:
- Development of open-source, cutting-edge technology  
- Launch of the **Orbital Temple PocketQube** satellite  
- Installation of the **ground station antenna**, a public space sculpture that connects Earth and outer space  

**Funding Goal:** $400,000 by 2023  

Your engagement will make it possible for thousands of people to connect with heaven ‚Äî and will directly support the professionals who have been working on this project since 2020.  

> **Launch us into the future of Art History with a donation of $50,000 ‚Äî or make an even greater impact.**  
>  
> Thank you and see you in Cape Canaveral in 2023 for the launch!

## From the Artist

There‚Äôs so much power in a name. *David, Abdias, Carolina.*  
Names evoke images, memories, connections. During the pandemic, it was rare to find a name in the news. Covid-19 victims became statistics ‚Äî hollow and cold numbers.  

Founding the **Innumerable Memorial (2020)** was a way to act, as an artist, during the pandemic in Brazil. This collective artwork gathers life stories of Covid-19 victims, written by volunteers who interviewed thousands of families.  

The project impacted about **1 in 6 adults in Brazil (~31 million people)**.  

As I listened to these stories, I understood that remembering is healing for the individual and protective for society.  

**Orbital Temple** continues that artistic practice ‚Äî investigating human connection and technology.  

*Kindly,*

## Concept

### What if heaven could be a place for everyone?

How does the idea of heaven affect our perceptions of **sexuality, abortion, euthanasia, the State, family, mental health, and human rights**?  

Most religions that imagine heaven or hell define strict rules for who belongs where ‚Äî shaping people‚Äôs lives on Earth.  

The **Orbital Temple Mission** proposes to shift these conceptions.  
If *all sentient beings* had a place in paradise, how would life on Earth change?

## Who Shall Ascend to Heaven?

**Orbital Temple (2022)** is the **first purely artistic orbital satellite from the Global South**.  

Its mission is to **question the symbolic colonization of heaven as paradise** ‚Äî the origins of its gatekeeping rules and their impact on human choices.  

The artwork consists of:
- A **satellite** designed to store billions of names  
- A **ground station antenna sculpture**  
- A **website** through which participants can send names of the deceased to ‚Äúheaven‚Äù  

> ‚ÄúThe name *Kalpana Chawla* has ascended to heaven and there it remains.‚Äù

The website, available in **50+ languages**, connects Earth and orbit ‚Äî letting anyone send a name and track the satellite‚Äôs position.

## Open Source Technology  
### For Future Generations from the Global South

All technology developed for the mission will be **open source** and available in **Portuguese, English, and Spanish**, fostering access to space exploration in the Global South.  

New projects ‚Äî artistic or scientific ‚Äî will be free to use the Orbital Temple as a foundation.  

All **carbon emissions** will be offset, and the **satellite has a planned re-entry**, leaving no debris behind.

## From Brazil to Beyond

The Orbital Temple Mission has **global potential**.  
It connects people passionate about **science, technology, and art**, and will **tour through museums, galleries, universities, and private institutions worldwide.**

The project also includes:
- A **documentary** on the making and launch  
- A **multilingual course** for teens on how to build and launch a satellite  
- A **collection of 24 NFTs** by contemporary artists hosted on the satellite
