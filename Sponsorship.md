# Orbital Temple — Sponsorship Strategy Document  
*Prepared for 2025–2026 Global Launch Cycle*  
**Author:** Edson Pavoni  
**Project:** Orbital Temple — The First Artistic Satellite from the Global South  

---

## 1. Overview

**Orbital Temple** is a participatory artwork that takes the form of a satellite in orbit, storing billions of names of departed beings and creating the first radically inclusive temple — beyond borders, religions, and nations.

The mission connects three dimensions:

1. **Artistic** — the satellite as sculpture and symbol.  
2. **Educational** — open-source satellite course for teens in the Global South.  
3. **Mediatic** — a documentary and viral question: *“What makes something a temple?”*

Each dimension offers distinct sponsorship opportunities, all united by one narrative:
> “Launch us into the future of Art History — help send the first artistic satellite from the Global South into space.”

## 2. Core Narrative

### 2.1. Philosophical Foundation
Derived from the *Orbital Temple Manifesto*:

> “No temple on Earth can be radically inclusive.  
> There is no place on Earth that can hold universal sacred.  
> Where could we build such a temple?  
> Space.”

The project reimagines **heaven as a commons**, a place that belongs to every sentient being.  
It questions the symbolic colonization of paradise and invites humanity to co-create a shared sacred.

### 2.2. Key Ideas for Communication
- **First Artistic Satellite from the Global South** — historical, geopolitical, and artistic significance.  
- **Radically Inclusive Temple** — a place beyond discrimination, nationality, and religion.  
- **Open Source Heaven** — technology freely shared to empower others to build and launch satellites.  
- **Art + Technology + Ritual** — merging ancient and future forms of transcendence.  
- **From Brazil to Beyond** — a South-to-Space narrative expanding the idea of who gets to define the heavens.
